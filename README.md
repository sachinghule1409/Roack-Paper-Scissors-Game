# Roack-Paper-Scissors-Game
In this game I take input from user with choice like 0)Scissor 1)Rock 2)Paper then use Random class for generating random number from system within range 0 to 2.
If user entered number and system generated number is same then print "Match Tied".
If user entered number is 0 and system generated number is 1 the print "You Loose".
If user entered number is 0 and system generated number is 2 the print "You Win".
If user entered number is 1 and system generated number is 0 the print "You Win".
If user entered number is 1 and system generated number is 2 the print "You Loose".
If user entered number is 2 and system generated number is 0 the print "You Loose".
If user entered number is 2 and system generated number is 1 the print "You Win".
